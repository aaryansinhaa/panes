## What is MCP?

> **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.

Think of MCP like **USB-C for AI**.
Just as USB-C provides a standard way to connect hardware, MCP provides a standard way to connect AI models to tools, data, and applications.
